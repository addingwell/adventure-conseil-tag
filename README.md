# Adenture Conseil Tag for Google Tag Manager Server Side

The Adventure Conseil Tag allows advertisers to store a server-side cookie and send a conversion event (S2S) to [Adventure Conseil](https://www.adventureconseil.com/ "Adventure Conseil's Homepage").

This tag tracks three events types:
- `page_view` reads Adventure Conseil's query parameter from the URL (`pba`) and stores it on a server-side cookie named `ac_pba`
- `purchase` sends the event to Adventure Conseil
- `generate_lead` sends the event to Adventure Conseil
